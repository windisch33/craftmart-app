**Calculation Logic**:
```typescript
// Item total calculation
itemTotal = quantity × unit_price × material_multiplier

// Segregate by tax status
taxableTotal = sum(items where is_taxable = true)
laborTotal = sum(items where is_taxable = false)

// Apply tax (only to taxable items)
taxAmount = taxableTotal × job.tax_rate
grandTotal = taxableTotal + laborTotal + taxAmount
```

### 📝 **Task 5.1: Critical Bug Fixes & Production Stabilization**
**Status**: ✅ Completed
**Date**: July 23, 2025
**Files**: Multiple components and services
**Priority**: CRITICAL - System was non-functional

**Issues Identified & Fixed**:

**🐛 Issue 1: Infinite Re-render Loop**
- **Problem**: JobForm step 3 caused infinite re-render loop with "Too many re-renders" error
- **Root Cause**: `validateForm(3)` called in submit button's disabled prop triggered state updates during render
- **Solution**: Created memoized `isFormValidForStep()` function without side effects
- **Files**: `JobForm.tsx`
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

**🐛 Issue 2: Double Popup Alerts**
- **Problem**: "Add Item" button triggered validation alerts twice
- **Root Cause**: `validateForm()` called in both button disabled state and click handler
- **Solution**: Separated validation into `isFormValid()` (render-safe) and `validateForm()` (action-safe)
- **Files**: `ProductSelector.tsx`
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

**🐛 Issue 3: Product Selection Blank Screen**
- **Problem**: Selecting products from dropdown caused TypeError crashes
- **Root Cause**: Database returning string values, but code calling `.toFixed()` without number conversion
- **Solution**: Wrapped all database values with `Number()` conversion
- **Files**: `ProductSelector.tsx`
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

**🐛 Issue 4: Products Not Saved to Jobs**
- **Problem**: Jobs created with $0.00 totals, products not persisting
- **Root Cause**: Job creation only saved basic data, sections and items were ignored
- **Solution**: Enhanced job creation flow to create job → sections → items sequentially
- **Files**: `Jobs.tsx`, `JobForm.tsx`
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

**🐛 Issue 5: API URL Inconsistency**
- **Problem**: Job service calls failing with 500 errors
- **Root Cause**: `jobService.ts` used hardcoded `/api` while others used `${API_BASE_URL}/api`
- **Solution**: Standardized all job service URLs to use environment variable pattern
- **Files**: `jobService.ts`
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

**🐛 Issue 6: Database Schema Constraint Violation**
- **Problem**: "null value in column 'product_type' violates not-null constraint"
- **Root Cause**: Database had hybrid table structure with required fields not provided by controller
- **Solution**: Updated `addQuoteItem` controller to include required `product_type` and `product_name`
- **Files**: `jobController.ts`
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

**🔧 Labor Handling Enhancement**
**Status**: ✅ Completed
**Files**: `SectionManager.tsx`, `ProductSelector.tsx`, `jobCalculations.ts`
**Issue Identified**: Labor is incorrectly handled at section level instead of product level

**Problem**: 
- Current implementation has "Labor Section" toggle when creating sections
- This forces ALL items in a section to be non-taxable
- Real-world usage: Each product (e.g., "6010 rail") has separate material cost (taxable) and labor cost (non-taxable)
- User should choose whether to include labor when adding each product

**Solution Implemented**:
- ✅ Removed section-level labor logic from SectionManager
- ✅ Added "Include Labor" checkbox to ProductSelector for each product
- ✅ Show separate material cost (taxable) and labor cost (non-taxable) breakdown
- ✅ Updated price calculations to handle both costs properly
- ✅ Fixed tax calculations to separate material (taxable) from labor (non-taxable)
- ✅ Removed "Labor" from default sections list
- ✅ Updated UI to show clear cost breakdown with visual differentiation

**Example After Fix**:
```
Product: 6010 Oak Rail 96"
[✓] Include Labor Installation
Price Breakdown:
  Material: $300.00 (taxable)
  Labor: $150.00 (non-taxable) 
  Total: $450.00
```

**Technical Notes**:
- Customer selection triggers tax rate lookup via customer's state
- Use `calculateTaxForState(customerState)` from backend
- Update totals on every item add/remove/modify
- Store draft in localStorage before submission

    job_id INTEGER REFERENCES jobs(id),
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,           -- "Basement", "Main Floor", etc.
    description TEXT,
    display_order INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    is_labor_section BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    is_misc_section BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Quote Items
CREATE TABLE quote_items (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    job_id INTEGER REFERENCES jobs(id),
    section_id INTEGER REFERENCES job_sections(id),
    part_number VARCHAR(100),
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    quantity DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
    unit_price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    line_total DECIMAL(10,2) GENERATED ALWAYS AS (quantity * unit_price) STORED,
    is_taxable BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Tax Calculation Reference
- Tax rates stored in `tax_rates` table by state
- Customer state determines job tax rate
- Only items with `is_taxable = true` have tax applied
- Labor sections typically have `is_taxable = false`

### Material Multipliers (Sample Data)
- Pine: 1.0x (base price)
- Oak: 1.0x 
- Poplar: 1.1x
- Cherry: 1.5x
- Maple: 1.6x
- Mahogany: 2.0x

## 🐛 **Issues & Solutions Log**

### Issue Log
**Issue #1: Labor Handling Architecture** (July 23, 2025) - ✅ RESOLVED
- **Problem**: Labor incorrectly implemented at section level instead of product level
- **Impact**: Users cannot mix taxable materials and non-taxable labor in same section
- **Root Cause**: Misunderstanding of real-world workflow - labor is per-product, not per-section
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed in Task 5.1

**Issue #2: Critical Production Bugs** (July 23, 2025) - ✅ RESOLVED
- **Problems**: Multiple system-breaking issues (infinite loops, blank screens, data not saving)
- **Impact**: System completely non-functional for job creation
- **Root Causes**: Various React render issues, API inconsistencies, database constraints
- **Status**: ✅ All 6 critical issues identified and fixed

### Technical Decisions Made
**Decision #1**: Product-Level Labor Inclusion (July 23, 2025) - ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Context**: Each product has `labor_install_cost` field but wasn't being used properly
- **Decision**: Add "Include Labor" checkbox per product rather than section-level toggle
- **Rationale**: Matches real-world quoting where labor is optional per product
- **Impact**: More flexible and accurate tax calculations

**Decision #2**: Memoized Validation Pattern (July 23, 2025) - ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Context**: React 19 strict mode causing infinite re-render loops with validation functions
- **Decision**: Separate render-safe validation (`isFormValid()`) from action-safe validation (`validateForm()`)
- **Rationale**: Prevents state updates during render while maintaining UX validation
- **Impact**: Stable rendering performance and proper error handling

### Testing Notes
**Production Testing Completed**: July 23, 2025
- ✅ End-to-end job creation with multiple products and sections
- ✅ Real-time price calculations with tax segregation
- ✅ Error handling and edge cases
- ✅ Mobile responsiveness across all components
- ✅ Database persistence and data integrity
- ✅ PDF generation integration
