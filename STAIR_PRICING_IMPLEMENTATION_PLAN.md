## Technical Specifications

### Pricing Algorithm Overview
```
1. Base Price Lookup
   - Match board type, material, and dimensions
   - Find applicable pricing rule within date range

2. Quantity Calculation
   - Apply appropriate riser count (box, open, double)
   - Calculate based on PRIC flags

3. Oversized Adjustments
   - Length increments: (extra_length / Len_Incr) √ó Len_Cost
   - Width increments: (extra_width / Wid_Incr) √ó Wid_Cost

4. Material Multipliers
   - Apply material-specific multipliers
   - Handle premium materials (Cherry: 1.7x, Walnut: 1.7x)

5. Additional Charges
   - Full mitre charges for open/double open
   - Special parts pricing
   - Labor costs per component

6. Final Calculation
   - Subtotal all components
   - Apply tax rate
   - Calculate total
```

### Database Schema Highlights

#### Key Relationships
```sql
stair_configurations -> jobs (many-to-one)
stair_board_prices -> stair_materials (many-to-one)
stair_board_prices -> stair_board_types (many-to-one)
stair_configurations -> stair_config_items (one-to-many)
```

#### Critical Indexes
- Board price lookups by type, material, dimensions
- Date range validations
- Active status filtering

### API Response Format
```typescript
interface StairPriceResponse {
  configuration: StairConfiguration;
  breakdown: {
    treads: PriceLineItem[];
    risers: PriceLineItem[];
    stringers: PriceLineItem[];
    specialParts: PriceLineItem[];
    labor: PriceLineItem[];
  };
  subtotal: number;
  taxAmount: number;
  total: number;
  warnings?: string[];
}
```
